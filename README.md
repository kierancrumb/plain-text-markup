# Plain Text Markup

A small **mostly** useless markup language that only uses plain text. Ptm uses ASCII art to make headers, images and all of its other features.

## Why?
Because it's coolðŸ˜Ž and i was bored.

## Features
- Headers
- Images as ASCII art
- Block quotes
- Unordered lists
- Horizontal rules
- Text blocks
- Preformatted text
- Paragraphs

### Headers
Headers are made by putting 1 to 3 `#`s at the start of a line.
```
# biggest header
## less big header
### smallest header
```
### that's all i've thought of yet

## Installation
doesn't exist yet

## Usage
i'll think of this later
